        Adept Moves in Financial Crisis Clear Citigroup Chief’s Path to Top Job
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <img class="a-img" src="img/corbat.jpg"/>

        <div>Michael L. Corbat inherited one of Wall Street’s most thankless jobs after the financial crisis. As head of Citigroup’s “bad bank,” a segregated unit of unwanted investments, he was asked to haul the bank back from the brink.</div><br/>

        <div>But after years of shedding troubled assets and forging ties with regulators and board members, that once-grim position has now led Mr. Corbat to the top job at the company. Citigroup on Tuesday announced that Mr. Corbat would succeed Vikram S. Pandit, who stepped down after five years as chief executive.</div><br/>

        <div>“I am both humbled by the confidence the board has placed in me, and excited by the prospect of working closely with our management team and the board to take our company forward,” he said in a memo to employees on Tuesday. In a conference call, he added that “I look forward to taking on the challenge of continuing what Vikram started.”</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Corbat, 52, has been a Citigroup lifer. He began his career at Salomon Brothers, which was taken over by Travelers in 1998, shortly before the merger with Citicorp that created a financial services behemoth. He began as a bond salesman in Atlanta, before climbing to managing director for high yield and derivatives.</div><br/>

        <div>“He is a great guy — knows clients and products well,” said Robert Wolf, the former UBS executive who worked with Mr. Corbat for about 10 years at Salomon Brothers and now runs the consulting firm 32 Advisors.</div><br/>

        <div>At Citigroup, executives portray Mr. Corbat as a jack-of-all-trades. His work has spread across the Citi’s many divisions, including both commercial and retail banking. When the bank ousted Sallie L. Krawcheck at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Corbat took over as head of the global wealth management unit.</div><br/>

        <div>His résumé also includes stints overseas, an important element at a firm that often crows about its overseas footprint. Citi dispatched Mr. Corbat to London in January to become chief executive of Citigroup’s broad operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</div><br/>

        <div>“From his nearly three decades at the company he brings deep and varied operating experience across a broad spectrum of the financial services industry,” Michael E. O’Neill, chairman of the Citigroup board, said in a statement on Tuesday.</div><br/>

        <div>In perhaps his most important role, Mr. Corbat helped steer the bank through the financial crisis. At the helm of Citi Holdings — the “bad bank” created in the aftermath of the crisis — he oversaw Citigroup’s disastrous mortgage portfolio and the sale of some $600 billion in noncore businesses like its student-lending operation.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank on Monday disclosed that the assets in Citi Holdings dwindled 31 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, significant progress for a unit that was once the albatross of the firm.</div><br/>

        <div>Some analysts have questioned why Mr. Corbat has not moved more rapidly to unwind the bad bank. Others wondered why Mr. Corbat offered little in the way of specifics about his approach to running the firm.</div><br/>

        <div>But Mr. Corbat, who made $9 million in 2010, said that the record of Citi Holdings was one that “few can criticize.”</div><br/>

        <div>As Citigroup slowly regained its footing after repaying $45 billion in taxpayer bailout funds, Mr. Corbat became a potential heir to Mr. Pandit. The Citi Holdings position afforded him close access to Mr. O’Neill, who ran the Citi Holdings Oversight Committee since 2009.</div><br/>

        <div>The Citi Holdings job also exposed Mr. Corbat to regulators, who kept a close eye on the unit and have had a strained relationship with the bank since the crisis.</div><br/>

        <div>“It is critical for this firm and all firms to have strong relationships with our regulators, and I think we do,” Mr. O’Neill said on the conference call. But “things can always be improved,” he said.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank built some modest good will with regulators on Monday evening, people briefed on the matter said, when Mr. O’Neill personally called top officials to inform them of the management shuffle.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Pandit had a mixed track record in Washington. While he embraced much of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law, drawing private praise from some officials, Mr. Pandit also incurred the ire of regulators when the bank failed to acquire Wachovia, which was flailing during the 2008 crisis. Tensions boiled over after a Citigroup executive called the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a “tertiary regulator.” Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Corbat, by contrast, has somewhat cozier ties in Washington. He has made occasional trips to Washington, including last October when he met with Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve board governor, and has donated to Democratic and Republican causes, including Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.</div><br/>

        <div>“He was involved in several meetings with us,” said Sheila C. Bair, former head of the F.D.I.C. who knows Mr. Corbat from meetings during the financial crisis. “He was prepared and he knew his stuff,” she said in an interview.</div><br/>

        <div>A native of Bristol, Conn., Mr. Corbat is active in the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce and is a board member of the United States Ski and Snowboard Team Foundation.</div><br/>

        <div>While a student at Harvard, he was an all-conference lineman on the football team. The 230-pound Mr. Corbat seemed poised for a career in the N.F.L. But he earned an economics degree in 1983 and set off for Wall Street.</div><br/>

        <div>Referring to his college career at the time, Mr. Corbat told The Harvard Crimson, “It has given me everything that I would have hoped for.”</div><br/>

        Citi CEO Corbat: 'Not Afraid' to Make Additional Cuts
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>By: Kayla Tausche, Jesse Bergman</div><br/>

        <div>While a massive restructuring effort to lay off 11,000 and cut billions from the budget is already underway, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat sounded a clear message to investors and analysts on Tuesday: I could wield the axe further if necessary.</div><br/>

        <div>Delivering the keynote presentation at Citigroup's financial services conference in New York, Corbat outlined a clear and simple set of benchmarks for investors to use in evaluating the company—those include efficiency targets and expected returns on assets.</div><br/>

        <div>In outlining the targets, Corbat said he is a "strong believer that you are what you measure."</div><br/>

        <div>In search of efficiencies beyond the $1 billion in annual cost cuts announced in December, Corbat said the bank identified 21 markets which could be scaled back or exited if there isn't a "clear path to returns". Those markets currently make up roughly 10 percent of the bank's revenue.</div><br/>

        <div>Other units are already in the wind-down process, including roughly 60 percent of the company's credit card products, which Corbat said will be eliminated.</div><br/>

        <div>Perhaps the biggest overhang on returns, however, is the firm's "bad bank," Citi Holdings, a repository for all the bank's toxic assets leftover from the financial crisis. The unit represents only eight percent of the company's assets, yet sucks up a third of the company's capital—since regulators require the bank to keep more capital on hand for higher-risk assets.</div><br/>

        <div>"We're fighting with one hand behind our back," Corbat said of the capital drag. If it were freed up that capital could likely be returned to shareholders or redeployed into other Citi business lines.</div><br/>

        <div>Citi, like other large banks, is currently awaiting a verdict from the Federal Reserve over whether it can return more capital. Last year, regulators struck down Citi's overzealous requests, an embarrassment for the bank and then-chief Vikram Pandit.</div><br/>

        <div>Analysts at KBW expect the bank to return virtually nothing to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Corbat said this year, there's "no room for error.</div><br/>

        <div>Investors, though, were encouraged by Corbat's remarks: Citi shares spiked 2.5 percent in mid-day trading.</div><br/>

        Citigroup Meeting What a Difference a Year Makes
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>By: Kayla Tausche|CNBC General Assignment Reporter</div><br/>

        <div>Perhaps Citigroup can finally sleep.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank fielded dozens of questions Wednesday at its annual shareholder meeting over impending regulation, the bank's strategy, and even the status of personal accounts. The exhaustive, three-hour question-and-answer session—in a marked difference from prior years—saw shareholders praise management and the board for revitalizing the bank's strategy.</div><br/>

        <div>"The Mike & Mike show is off to a great start," said Mike Mayo, outspoken analyst-cum-Citi shareholder at CLSA, referring to the presenting duet of chairman Mike O'Neill and freshman CEO Mike Corbat. </div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup shareholders descended upon midtown Manhattan's Hilton Hotel with axes to grind. The prior year, the bank failed the Federal Reserve's stress tests, offered an underperforming CEO a multi-million dollar pay package, and botched a deal to sell its brokerage to Morgan Stanley.</div><br/>

        <div>The O'Neill-led board moved swiftly in October to replace Pandit with Corbat, who wasted little time identifying $1.1 billion in cost cuts and exiting non-core businesses.</div><br/>

        <div>"We've seen Mike [Corbat] operate. He's a manager, he's decisive, and he gets results," said O'Neill in praise of the work done thus far in his tenure. Citigroup shares rose as much as 2 percent intraday.</div><br/>

        <div>The bulk of Wednesday's questioning concerned not just the current turnaround, but also the well-telegraphed idea that Citigroup, ultimately, could get drastically smaller, or even break up. Both executives said doing so at present would be doing so in an "uneconomic" way.</div><br/>

        <div>In the meantime, Corbat said in his remarks: "The core strategy remains the same."</div><br/>

        <div>Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, which owns $20 million in Citi stock, proposed in November that shareholders should get to vote on a company strategy to disclose more fully the sum-of-the-parts valuation of the bank, or pursue a more rigorous restructuring. The Securities and Exchange Commission nixed the proposal on the grounds of it being too vague.</div><br/>

        <div>"The argument we've had is—while they've done a lot, they need to do more," said Matt Patsky, CEO of Trillium, in a phone interview. "There's still more opportunity to unlock value. Why not have that conversation?" Patsky said in his conversations with Citigroup management, they expressed commitment to the existing strategy.</div><br/>

        <div>"If we find that this doesn't result in value creation for shareholders, we'll deal with it [then]," O'Neill said at Wednesday's meeting. (Trillium, while mentioned during the Q&A, was not in attendance.)</div><br/>

        <div>That strategy means refocusing on the world's top 150 cities, serving a denser population, and building more services online—all while whittling away at the "bad bank" Citi Holdings, currently a major headwind on the bank's capital base.</div><br/>

        <div>Shareholders, including Russell Forenza, a longtime Citi shareholder claiming his stock had lost $1.5 million over the years, seemed appeased by Wednesday's message. Forenza had no fewer than 10 turns at the mic, lambasting the company for its 2011 reverse stock split, its steep legal fees, and the overinvolvement of company directors. In the end, even Forenza told management they were doing a "great job" – a tone signaling a departure from years' past.</div><br/>

        <div>The meeting ended on a markedly different note, too, with some 90 percent of investors approved the year's pay package for new CEO Mike Corbat—after striking down the same measure for former CEO Vikram Pandit in 2011.</div><br/>

        <div>During the time that Corbat—who will earn $11.5 million for 2012—has served as CEO, shares have risen nearly 20 percent. During 2011, for which Vikram Pandit was set to receive $15 million in compensation, shares fell 44 percent.</div><br/>

        <div>As he was leaving the meeting, CNBC caught up with the notoriously private O'Neill on his impressions of the event. "I was hoping to answer shareholders' questions—which I think we did."</div><br/>

        Citigroup results hit by bondtrading slowdown
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc posted weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday as bond market trading volume dropped, hurting revenue at the No. 3 U.S. bank and across Wall Street.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank's bond trading revenue dropped 26 percent, or $956 million, excluding an accounting adjustment, and revenue at most of its major businesses dropped.</div><br/>

        <div>The fall in fixed-income revenue could spell trouble for investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley , which post results later this week. Volumes dropped after the Federal Reserve said it plans to continue its bond buying stimulus program, giving assurance to investors that they can hold onto their bonds for a little longer.</div><br/>

        <div>Late in the quarter, investors also grew increasingly concerned about the government's fiscal impasse, which made many reluctant to trade.</div><br/>

        <div>"I don't think anybody wanted to get in front of that," said Diane Jaffee, who oversees about $6.5 billion of relative value mutual funds for TCW, and counts Citigroup among her top 10 holdings. The budget and debt ceiling crises continue to weigh on trading volumes in the fourth quarter, analysts said.</div><br/>

        <div>Investors pointed to Citi's efforts to control costs as the most positive part of the quarterly earnings. Similar moves could be imminent at other banks, especially as Wall Street bonus season - typically a huge part of their budgets - approaches.</div><br/>

        <div>In last year's third quarter Citigroup took a $4.7 billion charge before taxes, related to selling its Smith Barney brokerage business. For the bank's board, that hit was the last straw in a series of perceived missteps that ended up costing Vikram Pandit, then the bank's chief executive, his job.</div><br/>

        <div>Pandit's successor, Michael Corbat, has struggled to improve Citigroup's fortunes in an environment where client business is tepid and new regulations are raising banks' expenses. Those regulations are designed to make the banking system safer after the financial crisis, which forced Citigroup to seek government rescues three times.</div><br/>

        <div>'UNEVEN' BUSINESS CONDITIONS</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat told analysts in a conference call that business conditions would remain "uneven" for the rest of the year.</div><br/>

        <div>"While many of the factors which influence our revenues are not within our full control, we certainly can control our costs, and I am pleased with our expense discipline and improved efficiency year-to-date," Corbat said in a statement.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank's expenses fell nearly $500 million from the second quarter to $11.66 billion as performance-based compensation and transaction costs fell, partly reflecting a weak revenue environment, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach told analysts.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup, which has said it was aiming to reduce costs by $1.2 billion annually, said on Tuesday it plans to cut areas like marketing expenses in the fourth quarter. But Gerspach said that no major new expense reduction plans are expected in the quarter.</div><br/>

        <div>Investors said that from the outside, it is hard to evaluate how the bank's cost-cutting is affecting its daily operations.</div><br/>

        <div>"All these banks are doing a lot on that front (cost cutting), including Citigroup, but it's hard to see from the outside what is happening," said David Ellison, portfolio manager in Boston at Hennessy Funds, which has about $4 billion under management and owns Citigroup shares.</div><br/>

        <div>"There's a dumpster in the driveway, but all the activity is in the house, and you can't tell what's happening inside."</div><br/>

        <div>CUSTOMER TRADING SLOWDOWN</div><br/>

        <div>The third quarter is typically a slow one for bond trading, a state that was only exacerbated by the Fed announcement, according to analysts.</div><br/>

        <div>Under generally accepted accounting principles, Citigroup's net income rose to $3.23 billion, or $1.00 per share, from $468 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.</div><br/>

        <div>Excluding the Smith Barney charge, as well as the impact of tax benefits and changes in the value of Citigroup debts and those of trading partners, third-quarter earnings slipped to $3.26 billion, or $1.02 per share, from $3.27 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. On that basis, revenue fell 5 percent to $18.22 billion.</div><br/>

        <div>Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.04 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A spokeswoman for the bank said that estimate was comparable to the adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup shares were up 14 cents to $49.74 in midday trading.</div><br/>

        <div>On some fronts, Corbat is making progress. Citigroup has winnowed down the assets it is looking to shed, known as Citi Holdings, to $122 billion, down 29 percent from a year earlier and down 7 percent from the second quarter. Citi Holdings now accounts for a little more than 6 percent of the bank's overall assets, compared with about 9 percent in last year's third quarter.</div><br/>

        <div>But results were weak at many businesses at Citicorp, the bank's main operations. Revenue for its retail banking business fell 7 percent to $9.24 billion, and revenue for its securities and banking business fell 2 percent to $4.75 billion.</div><br/>

        <div>Revenue at its transaction services business was $2.613 billion, about $6 million below the same quarter last year. The bank's transaction services business, long a key driver of profitability, is facing intense competition now.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank earned enough taxable income in the United States to use about $500 million of its deferred tax assets, which amount to tax credits and other benefits that Citigroup can only use when it earns enough money domestically. The bank had about $54 billion of deferred tax assets at the end of June, most of which relate to U.S. taxes.</div><br/>

        Citigroup's Corbat Says Environment to Stay 'Challenging'
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat said he expects the environment for investment banking will remain “challenging” and weigh on compensation.</div><br/>

        <div>“People recognize the times we are in, these are challenging times,” Corbat, 52, said in an interview with with Bloomberg Television’s Erik Schatzker at the World Economic Forum in Davos today. “Things will remain challenging going forward for a period of time. Our people recognize that.”</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat replaced the ousted Vikram Pandit as CEO at the third-biggest U.S. bank in October. He has since announced plans to fire about 11,000 employees and pull back from certain markets as he seeks to cut Citigroup’s costs and boost rewards for shareholders. Profit at the lender’s ongoing businesses slid 8 percent last year while costs rose.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup cut investment bankers’ bonuses by 10 percent to 20 percent globally after a revenue slump, people with knowledge of the matter said last week.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat said the firm can still be “absolutely competitive,” on banker pay.</div><br/>

        <div>“I think morale is good,” he said, without saying whether the company plans to cut more jobs. “Our employees are very confident around the strategy if you think about what’s going on in the world today.”</div><br/>

        <div>‘Be Mindful’</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat is reversing part of the expansion pursued by Pandit, 56, co-chairman of last year’s Davos meeting. Citigroup directors led by Chairman Michael O’Neill ousted Pandit after concluding that he’d mismanaged the bank’s operations.</div><br/>

        <div>The New York-based bank has jumped 15 percent in New York trading since Dec. 5, when Corbat announced the 11,000 firings and his plans to reduce consumer operations in markets including Pakistan and Turkey. The 24-company KBW Bank Index (BKX) gained about 10 percent for the same period.</div><br/>

        <div>“In a challenging environment, you have got to be mindful of expenses and we are,” Corbat said.</div><br/>

        <div>Regulators have ordered lenders to raise capital to prevent a repeat of the taxpayer-funded bailouts that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Banks will hold more reserves against riskier assets under the rules, known as Basel III, due to be implemented in 2019.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat told CNBC in an interview from Davos that Citigroup has built “sizeable liquidity” and will continue “to build capital.” He also said that it’s important to have a “level playing field” on stricter capital rules around the globe.</div><br/>

        <div>The new CEO has been overhauling Citigroup’s operations. Senior executives including Vice Chairman Lewis “Lew” Kaden and head of emerging markets Hamid Biglari are leaving the firm. Corbat reduced the duties of Don Callahan, the lender’s head of operations and technology, and promoted Jamie Forese and Manuel Medina-Mora to co-presidents.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup should be viewed by the public as “indisputably safe-and-sound institution,” Corbat told Bloomberg TV. Still, Citigroup “needs to do a better job of telling that,” he said.</div><br/>

        Citigroup's Michael Corbat Not Your Average Wall Street CEO
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>If you want to crack the code of a company -- to really understand what makes it tick as a business and, therefore, as an investment -- one of the things you have to get your head around is who's at the top: the person making the day-to-day and long-term decisions that will eventually make or break the company and, possibly, your portfolio.</div><br/>

        <div>For Citigroup  (NYSE: C) , that person is CEO Michael Corbat. Here's the second of two articles taking an in-depth look at this relative newcomer to the superbank's top spot: where he came from, some of the important things he's said or done, and why you could arguably buy stock in the country's third-largest bank solely because of his ascendancy to CEO.</div><br/>

        <div>Say what you mean</div><br/>

        <div>Right off the bat, Corbat did something that impressed me, or rather said something that impressed me: "I am ... humbled by the confidence the board has placed in me," Corbat said the day he became CEO. "I look forward to taking on the challenge of continuing what Vikram started." </div><br/>

        <div>Corbat didn't have to use the word "humbled." Can you imagine this word coming out of the mouth of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, or Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein? Now, I happen to like both of those guys, and think they're top notch CEOs, but each in their own way has a certain master-of-the-universe arrogance about them. Blankfein's is more subdued, and Dimon's is more brash, but it's there in both of them. I haven't seen that tendency, yet, in Corbat.</div><br/>

        <div>In the above statement, Corbat also demonstrated humility just by the mere mention of his predecessor, Vikram Pandit. Pandit saw Citi through the darkest days of the financial crisis, and began the process of stabilization that Corbat is still building on. By giving credit where credit was due, Corbat not only demonstrated humility, but fundamental decency -- rare qualities on Wall Street.</div><br/>

        <div>Mean what you say</div><br/>

        <div>Following up that auspicious beginning to his tenure as CEO, in March of this year, Corbat was addressing a group of 300 Citi executives at a Hilton Hotel in East Brunswick, NJ, where he told them: "You are what you measure." Upon reading this, my initial thought was, "How boring." But then it dawned on me that this was exactly the kind of thinking Citi needed at the top.</div><br/>

        <div>Again, you'd never hear Jamie Dimon uttering a phrase like this, but Jamie Dimon is exactly the kind of leader Citi doesn't need right now. Four years out from the financial crisis, when Pandit departed, Citi was still, to some degree, like a rudderless ocean liner. As such, Citi didn't need a swashbuckling, seat-of-the-pants captain. Citi needed a steady hand, one that was going to calmly reassert order, and give employees concrete metrics to live and work by. Boring? Maybe, but it was just what the situation required, and still does.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat had the opportunity to impress me again in March of this year, this time, with his actions following the superbank's 2013 stress tests. If you recall, Citi failed its 2012 stress test, but, in 2013, it not only passed its stress test, but also outperformed lean, mean banking powerhouse Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC  ) -- not to mention investor darling and fellow post-crisis banking basket case Bank of America.</div><br/>

        <div>To make a long story short, based on its performance, Citi had every right to ask the Federal Reserve to increase its shareholder dividend following its successful 2013 stress test, but it didn't. Why? To the best of my knowledge, Corbat never commented, but my best guess is he was more concerned with conserving capital and repairing the bank's balance sheet than ingratiating himself with shareholders by way of capital return.</div><br/>

        <div>Foolish bottom line</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat is a Citi lifer, and takes great pride in his bank. He wants to see Citi's health and reputation as a great financial institution restored, even if that mean asking shareholders to be patient. That's the kind of long-term thinking any Fool can get behind.</div><br/>

        <div>In addition to the above, Corbat knows the bank like the back of his hand, having worked in many different areas of Citi's vast financial empire, including critical businesses like Citi Holdings, and foreign operations.</div><br/>

        <div>I would never tell a potential investor to only consider leadership when deciding whether or not to invest in a company, but leadership has become my top consideration. The CEO is the captain of the company ship, and can, quite literally, sail it into clear waters, or into the mouth of a hurricane, as we clearly saw happen with many banks in the run-up to the financial crisis.</div><br/>

        <div>Certainly, do the rest of your due diligence on Citigroup before deciding whether or not to invest; but when push comes to shove, also give Michael Corbat his due. </div><br/>

        Citigroup's new CEO has a lot to tackle
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Michael Corbat is shifting from running Citi's bad bank, to running one that is still in not great shape.</div><br/>

        <div>FORTUNE -- Citigroup's new CEO Michael Corbat was an ivy league football star, who turned heads in the Harvard cafeteria.</div><br/>

        <div>"He was extremely well rounded," says Andrew Doctoroff, a fellow Harvard student, who wrote about the then All-Ivy offensive lineman in The Harvard Crimson in 1982. "He kept his athletic prowess in perspective."</div><br/>

        <div>Even back then, the 6'3'', 230-pound Corbat had his sights on tackling investment banking. He's now landed in one of the biggest jobs on Wall Street, and perhaps the toughest.</div><br/>

        <div>On Tuesday, Citigroup (C) said Corbat, 52, would take over from Vikram Pandit as the firm's new CEO. Pandit brought Citi back from its near death experience, when it had to be bailed out twice by the government. It has since paid Uncle Sam back. But the bank has struggled to grow. Recently, Citi missed out on a boom in the mortgage market. What's more, Citi is still stuck with billions of dollars of assets that the bank says it no longer wants to own, but can't seem to figure out how to get rid of. The troubled assets have continued to drag down Citi's earnings.</div><br/>

        <div>"We have the right footprint and the right resources," Corbat told analysts on conference call on Tuesday afternoon. "It's up to us to make sure we use these properly."</div><br/>

        <div>Unlike Pandit, who was brought into the bank in a controversial acquisition shortly before being picked as CEO, Corbat is a lifer of the Citi organization. "He's had a broader range of roles leading up to the job than Pandit," says a former Citi executive who worked with Corbat. "He's a capable guy and a good salesman."</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat's first job was working for Salomon Brothers in Atlanta. But by 1987, he had been transferred to Solly's legendary New York office, which later became the subject of Michael Lewis' famous Wall Street book Liar's Poker. A debt specialist, Corbat rose to be the head of high-yield bonds and emerging markets at Solly, before the firm was merged in a series of acquisitions with Citibank to form Citigroup.</div><br/>

        <div>Sandy Weill, the former CEO of Citigroup, said that he knows Corbat well and thought Citi's board had made a good choice. "He has been a great manager for Citi in all of the important positions he has held," said Weill. "He is respected by the people within the company and he will be a good leader for the team in the future."</div><br/>

        <div>Since the Citigroup merger, Corbat has headed up a number of businesses at the firm, including corporate bank and its wealth management division, and has spent time in London and Hong Kong. Shortly after the financial crisis, Pandit named Corbat the head of Citi Holdings, the group of businesses, including subprime lending and the Salomon Smith Barney brokerage division, that bank was looking to get rid of. As head of that division, Corbat helped the firm dispose of $500 billion of unwanted assets in a little over three years. At the beginning of this year, he took over the firm's Europe, Middle East and Africa opperations.</div><br/>

        <div>"Pandit put Corbat in charge of the bad bank and the sense is that he did a good job with it," says an executive recruiter who has worked with Citi.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat is a Connecticut native. He is listed as the owner of a 4-bedroom, 1-and-a-half-bath, 3,500 square foot Manhattan apartment on Central Park West. The apartment has a fireplace and exposed wood beams in the living room. But Corbat doesn't appear to live there. According to the real estate website Streeteasy, the apartment was rented out in March for $33,000 a month. Corbat also owns a 6,300-square-foot house in Wilson, Wyoming. That house was estimated to be worth $3.7 million in 2010, according to real estate website Trulia.</div><br/>

        <div>Pay seems to be part of the reason for Pandit's department. Earlier this year, shareholders voted to reject a $15 million pay package for the Citi's former CEO. Corbat said he will take $1.5 million as a base salary, plus a bonus to be determined later.</div><br/>

        Citigroup's New CEO is a banker. Imagine that
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <img width="50%" src="img/corbat2.jpg"/>
        <div>In December, Citigroup's new CEO, Michael Corbat, appeared at a meeting of company alumni in Manhattan. It was their first interaction with Corbat as chief, and between the unceremonious ouster of his predecessor, Vikram Pandit, and the bank's disastrous half-decade, the mood was glum. Corbat stepped to the mike and displayed the blue cufflinks he was wearing, imprinted with an old Citi logo. They'd been sent to him by the wife of a recently deceased employee of 46 years who'd been so proud to work for Citi that he'd had them made. The widow sent Corbat the cufflinks because she hoped he'd be able to revive the type of pride her husband once felt. Corbat looked out at his audience. That's what I care most deeply about, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>"I remember hearing kind of a gasp," says one of the attendees, Hans Morris, a former CFO of Citi's institutional and capital markets businesses. "He just won over the room."</div><br/>

        <div>Slowly and quietly, Michael Corbat is beginning to win over more than a room of alumni. Seven months into his tenure, Corbat, 53, is emerging as a fitting leader for a company trying to restore its tarnished reputation. He isn't flashy or nakedly ambitious. He's thoughtful rather than spontaneous. And he's an incrementalist, not a revolutionary, as we'll see from his strategy for Citi. "I'm not somebody who throws myself out in front of things," he says with a wry smile in a rare interview.</div><br/>

        Citigroup's New CEO Shakes Up Management Team
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Newly-named Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat named a group of executives to top positions within the company on Monday, moving quickly to solidify his management team as the troubled mega bank undergoes a broad revamp of its strategy and streamlines its business.</div><br/>

        <div>Less than three months after ascending to Citi's top job, and a month after announcing mass layoffs and branch closures globally, Corbat appointed Citi veterans Jamie Forese and Manuel Medina-Mora as co-presidents. He also tapped Jim Cowles as CEO of the bank's crucial Europe, Middle East and Africa region.</div><br/>

        <div>Meanwhile, Corbat also nominated Brian Leach as head of the bank's risk and strategy department, which gives him broad authority over audit, compliance, and strategy. Brad Hu, who now serves as head of risk for the Asia Pacific region, will be named the bank's chief risk officer, reporting to Leach.</div><br/>

        <div>Calling the men a group of "incredibly strong leaders," Corbat said in a statement that he would be "relying on their skills and experience as we navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead."</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat took over Citi's top job in October, after former CEO Vikram Pandit resigned, a move that took a number of Wall Street observers by surprise. Reports later surfaced that differences over strategy and performance had surfaced between Pandit and other board members.</div><br/>

        <div>Forese is a known commodity among Citi watchers who in the past was short-listed as a potential candidate to succeed Pandit. Medina, a former CEO of Banamex, one of Mexico's largest banks. He also has experience in consumer banking, and once headed Citi's Latin America operations.</div><br/>

        <div>According to some analysts, having successors and clear lines of authority have become more than just palace intrigue. In an industry buffeted by challenging economic conditions and scandal, investors are paying closer attention to who might be tapped to take over the executive suite in the event of a CEO's sudden departure.</div><br/>

        <div>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis that nearly felled the global banking giant, Citi has been among the worst performing Wall Street banks, and still bears the scars of the meltdown that prompted a worldwide recession.</div><br/>

        <div>Now being headed by its fourth CEO in less than a decade, Citi has seen far more churn in its top position than several of its Wall Street peers, including J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, both portraits of executive stability.</div><br/>

        <div>Changeover in the executive suite, in addition to its hangover from the housing boom and bust, has forced the bank to downsize for the better part of the last six years. In December, Citi announced a plan to slash 11,000 jobs and close branches worldwide. Meanwhile, the financial giant has fended off calls from some investors to either break up the company or streamline more aggressively.</div><br/>

        <div>Last year, former Citigroup CEO Sanford "Sandy" Weill made a surprising call to unwind the financial supermarket template he helped to create back in the 1990s, when he merged Travelers Group with Citibank.</div><br/>

        Citigroup’s Corbat Says Spending Needed for Full Recovery
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Michael Corbat, hunting for revenue seven months into his tenure as chief executive officer of Citigroup Inc. (C), said the improving U.S. housing market and declining unemployment won’t ignite the nation’s economy unless companies start spending.</div><br/>

        <div>“We continue to see corporations defer hiring, we continue to see them deferring capital expenditure,” said Corbat, 53, in his first television interview in Asia, with Bloomberg Television’s Susan Li in Hong Kong. “Until we really see the other side -- that corporate side -- step in, I don’t think we can look and say that we’ve really got a full U.S. recovery.”</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat and his fellow CEOs at other U.S. banks need stronger economic growth to fuel revenue that’s being undermined by a slump in trading and regulators’ efforts to rein in risks in the wake of 2008’s credit-market turmoil. While the nation’s six biggest lenders increased total first-quarter profit by 45 percent, their combined revenue fell, leaving most of them to rely on a mix of tax benefits, staff reductions and cost cuts to increase earnings.</div><br/>

        <div>“What we see in the U.S. economy is a consumer that is slowly healing,” said Corbat, whose New York-based bank is the country’s third-largest by assets, behind JPMorgan (JPM) Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. “We’ve seen it in terms of house prices starting to come back up but, interestingly, we haven’t seen the follow-through on the corporate side.”</div><br/>

        <div>Housing Recovery</div><br/>

        <div>Median prices for single-family homes rose in the first quarter from a year earlier in 89 percent of 150 metropolitan areas, as the U.S. housing market extended its recovery from a five-year slump, the National Association of Realtors said in a report May 9. The rebound has helped improve sentiment, with the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index at minus 29.5 in the week ended May 5, close to the highest level in more than five years.</div><br/>

        <div>While corporations have resumed hiring, they’re still showing restraint. When the U.S. economy slumped during the latest recession, business investment in equipment and software plunged even more, causing its share of gross domestic product to shrink to 6.4 percent by mid-2009, almost a four-decade low. At 7.5 percent in this year’s first quarter, the share is still below both its pre-recession level and the record 9.6 percent reached in mid-2000.</div><br/>

        <div>President Barack Obama, in an annual economic message to Congress in March, said job creation is the “top priority” of his second term. In announcing a $3.8 trillion budget proposal last month, he called for $50 billion in infrastructure spending and the development of high-tech “manufacturing hubs” to spur private investment and employment.</div><br/>

        <div>Job Cuts</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat, who previously led a unit that disposed of Citigroup’s unwanted assets, replaced Vikram Pandit, 56, as CEO in October after Pandit navigated the bank through a near collapse and repaid a $45 billion U.S. bailout. Since taking the helm, Corbat has announced plans to cut 11,000 workers and pull back from markets such as Turkey, Pakistan and Uruguay.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup was alone among the largest U.S. banks this year in seeing its shares rise in the daily trading session after reporting first-quarter results. Excluding accounting adjustments, the bank’s revenue rose 3 percent, helped by hedges and earnings from advising companies on deals. The stock has climbed 33 percent since Corbat took over, compared with a 13 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.</div><br/>

        <div>“We looked at some things that we needed to do in terms of right-sizing our company,” Corbat said. “Those were very difficult decisions to make.”</div><br/>

        <div>Citi Holdings</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat has worked at Citigroup and its predecessors since graduating in 1983 from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and played football as an all-conference offensive guard. He started at Salomon Brothers Inc., which became part of Citigroup under Sandy Weill in the 1990s, and learned about the company’s operations while moving among its divisions. Pandit, in contrast, joined Citigroup as a hedge-fund manager after an earlier career at Morgan Stanley.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat became head of emerging markets in Citigroup’s fixed-income unit, and took over corporate lending in 2004. Four years later, he was assigned to run the wealth-management division, which included serving ultra-high-net-worth clients.</div><br/>

        <div>Pandit assigned him in April 2009 to divest $573 billion of assets as permanent head of the Citi Holdings unit, which held unwanted businesses. They included private-equity stakes, auto loans, a life insurer, a student-loan firm, a fund-of-hedge-funds business as well as mortgages and corporate bonds.</div><br/>

        <div>Embracing ‘Dull’</div><br/>

        <div>By the end of 2011, when Corbat was transferred to become the bank’s European regional chief, the assets in Citi Holdings had been cut 61 percent to $225 billion. When overseeing businesses, he said he prefers a methodical, multistep process - - a management approach Fortune magazine called “a little dull” in an article this month.</div><br/>

        <div>“I like to study the question or the problem or the opportunity in hand, work with the team to come with the right answer, make a decision and act upon it,” Corbat said in the Bloomberg interview. “Some people have said that, actually, today they pretty much like their bankers dull.”</div><br/>

        <div>Companies in the U.S. have added 6.15 million workers to payrolls since February 2010, when employment reached a decade low in the aftermath of the worst recession since the Great Depression. (INDU) That leaves the level 2.58 million workers short of the peak reached in January 2008, according to figures from the Labor Department.</div><br/>

        <div>‘Slow, Stingy’</div><br/>

        <div>“It’s been slow, it’s been stingy,” Corbat said of job creation in the U.S. “But it’s started. So I think we’re seeing signs, but we’ve got more to do.”</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat spoke in Hong Kong after concluding a day-and-a-half of management committee meetings in the city.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup, which began operations in the Asia-Pacific region in 1902, will devote a “meaningful” share of resources to expanding there, he said, without providing specific numbers. About a third of the 150 cities identified by the bank as important markets are in that region, he said. The firm is focused on consumer banking and providing services to corporate clients in those countries, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>Revenue from Asia at Citicorp, the division that contains trading and investment banking, climbed 1 percent from a year earlier to about $4 billion, accounting for about 20 percent of the company’s total sales. The unit’s profit from Asia was $1.1 billion, 29 percent of Citigroup’s net income, according to a financial supplement.</div><br/>

        <div>Wealthy Urbanites</div><br/>

        <div>In consumer banking -- where first-quarter revenue from the region fell 2 percent and profit dropped 17 percent -- Citigroup will focus on the “mass affluent” in cities, rather than jockey with domestic lenders in the countryside.</div><br/>

        <div>“You’re not going to see us competing in any country really in the hillsides against the domestic banks,” Corbat said. “We’re going to be urban-based."</div><br/>

        <div>In its work with corporate clients, Citigroup is tapping into demand for services from “Asian champions” that are looking to expand manufacturing, shipping or energy operations abroad, he said.</div><br/>

        <div>“It’s not only a destination for our clients from elsewhere around the world,” Corbat said. “Asia is in the process of exporting a number of great companies around the world that we’re happy to be leading out of Asia.”</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup directors ousted Pandit after concluding that he mishandled key operations, causing setbacks with regulators and costing credibility with investors, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. Pandit had helped the company navigate the financial crisis, when the firm took the U.S. bailout to avoid collapse.</div><br/>

        <div>Pandit’s Legacy</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat already has avoided pitfalls that undermined Pandit. In March, his bank outperformed JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on key measures in the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test of U.S. lenders in a hypothetical downturn. The Fed approved Citigroup’s capital plan after rejecting Pandit’s proposals a year earlier.</div><br/>

        <div>At Corbat’s first annual shareholder meeting last month, a majority of investors also endorsed the firm’s compensation practices after objecting last year amid criticism that Pandit would collect millions of dollars too easily.</div><br/>

        <div>“Vikram managed the company through an extremely difficult time and made a series of very tough decisions that I think positioned the company extremely well,” Corbat said of his predecessor. “My goal, my ambition, my obligation is to make sure that as a company we execute against that.”</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup Chairman Michael O’Neill, 66, led Pandit’s ouster. He told shareholders last month that he’s “not intrusive” with Corbat in managing Citigroup.</div><br/>

        <div>Jamie Dimon, CEO and chairman of New York-based JPMorgan, faces a shareholder vote next week on whether he should relinquish his dual role.</div><br/>

        <div>Having a separate chairman “really leaves me to focus on the day-to-day running of the company,” Corbat said, declining to comment on competitors. “For us, it works very well.”</div><br/>

        Meet Michael Corbat, Citigroup's New Boss
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Like most Wall Streeters, Michael Corbat — the 52 year-old Connecticut native tapped on Tuesday to assume the reins of the troubled mega bank Citigroup — has an Ivy League pedigree and a background steeped in trading, corporate and investment banking.</div><br/>

        <div>Yet the former Harvard University football player lacks the name recognition possessed by most of the finance industry's other reigning titans.</div><br/>

        <div>Before the abrupt resignation of Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit, few people outside of Wall Street had heard the name Corbat, who currently serves as the head of Citi's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operation.</div><br/>

        <div>Indeed, Corbat is something of an enigma to analysts and Citigroup watchers — all of whom scrambled in the wake of the executive shuffle to make sense of why Pandit left so suddenly. Corbat's colleagues and acquaintances offered little detail to reporters about his personality or work habits. </div><br/>

        <div>"This is kind of a quick move but on the other hand, Corbat is the right guy to fill the spot, " said Jeffery Harte, a principal at Sandler O'Neill. Harte was one of the few commentators able to offer insights into Corbat's personal style.</div><br/>

        <div>"He's got personal skills...charisma and communication skills, " Harte said. "It was one of the things Vikram lacked, in getting the message out to both clients and investors. I mean, that's one of [Corbat's] strong suits."</div><br/>

        <div>Yet Pandit's sudden departure thrusts Corbat into the spotlight, barely a year after Citigroup exited the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program following three years on the government dole. He takes the helm just as Citi is steering itself back to normalcy following the 2008 financial crisis, which nearly toppled the global financial Goliath.</div><br/>

        <div>In a statement, Citi's chairman Michael O'Neill praised Corbat as having "demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities… [and] brings deep and varied operating experience across a broad spectrum of the financial services industry."</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat has been with the bank since 1983, when he graduated from Harvard with an economics degree and joined the fixed income sales department of Salomon Brothers — the investment bank bought by Travelers Group in 1998, which eventually merged with Citigroup later that same year.</div><br/>

        <div>Robert Wolf, the former UBS CEO, described Corbat to the New York Times as a man "who knows clients and products well." Wolf told the Times that the two men became acquainted during their college years, when Wolf also played football at the University of Pennsylvania.</div><br/>

        <div>Prior to taking the helm of Citi's EMEA operations, Corbat ran Citi Holdings, the bank's portfolio of non-core businesses and assets. During his tenure, he spearheaded Citi's efforts to shed more than 40 businesses, including its stake in Primerica, and aggressively cut more than $500 billion in assets from the bank's bloated balance sheet.</div><br/>

        <div>Before that, Corbat ran Citi's global emerging markets unit, where he oversaw emerging market fixed income sales and trading.</div><br/>

        <div>An unnamed former colleague compared Corbat to Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee, saying that the banking executive was a "very bland and typical American midwest type, " according to the Financial Times.</div><br/>

        <div>Although the source said Corbat was "not the most inspiring leader and certainly not the visionary type", he complemented the executive's intellect and managerial skills.</div><br/>

        <div>The bespectacled Corbat also took over Citi's global wealth management unit after Sallie Krawcheck — one of Wall Street's highest-ranking and most prominent female executives — vacated the position.</div><br/>

        <div>Having run both the bank's corporate and commercial banking operations, Corbat was once involved with managing the fallout of Orange County, California's bankruptcy. He also dabbled in the wave of sovereign debt restructurings that swept Latin America.</div><br/>

        <div>Some observers speculated that Corbat's experience in commercial banking — a departure from Pandit's background in risk management — could presage a shift back to Citi's old roots before it took on the mantle of financial supermarket. Investors cheered the move, bidding Citi's stock up more than a percent in afternoon New York trading.</div><br/>

        <div>While at Harvard, Corbat was an all-Ivy offensive guardsman on the Crimson's football team. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of EMI, The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team Foundation and BritishAmerican Business.</div><br/>

        Michael Corbat's Memo to Citi
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>New Citi CEO, Michael Corbat sent an introduction email to the company, shortly after today's resignation of Vikram Pandit. Full text below.</div><br/>

        <div>Dear Colleagues:</div><br/>

        <div>I am both humbled by the confidence the Board has placed in me, and excited by the prospect of working closely with our management team and the Board to take our Company forward. Together with our talented employees around the world, I am confident that we can realize Citi 's full potential while serving clients and creating rewarding new opportunities for our employees.</div><br/>

        <div>I say this as a true believer in this Company: I have spent my entire career here and have had the opportunity to see first-hand the dedication, talent, and innovative spirit that for 200 years has been the hallmark of how we serve our clients and the communities around the world in which we operate.</div><br/>

        <div>Over the last five years, Vikram has led Citi back to its roots as a bank, building on our legacy of serving clients and helping them on their journey from ambition to achievement. I believe the fundamentals we have in place today are strong and that we are on the right path. However, the environment is a challenging and dynamic one. Regulatory, legislative and economic changes around the world present headwinds as we redefine our relationships with all of our stakeholders.</div><br/>

        <div>To thrive, we must be vigilant about how we allocate our resources to ensure we are serving our clients and offering the products with the highest potential in the most productive markets. At the same time, we must deliver sustained profitability, improved operating efficiency and shareholder returns while ensuring that vigorous risk management and mitigation are always the cornerstone of how Citi operates.</div><br/>

        <div>As a first step, I'm going to take the next several weeks to immerse myself in the businesses and review reporting structures. These assessments will result in some changes, and I will make sure to communicate these changes with you as decisions are made so that you are informed and updated.</div><br/>

        <div>Make no mistake that our passion and collective strength are integral to taking full advantage of our unique global position and seizing the many opportunities the Board and I see for our Company. I know that you are working hard to serve our clients, and I thank you for your commitment and loyalty to Citi. During this leadership transition, we must not become distracted from continuing to serve our clients and delivering the strongest possible finish for the year.</div><br/>

        <div>In closing, I'd like to extend my fond personal appreciation to Vikram and John Havens for all they have achieved during their tenure at Citi's helm in the most turbulent economic times. Without their leadership, Citi would not be in a position to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead of us.</div><br/>

        <div>– Mike</div><br/>

        Mike Corbat receives praise for turning Citigroup around
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>NEW YORK — It's been nine months since Mike Corbat was handed the reins of Citigroup and tasked with turning around the struggling banking giant. On Monday, the bank announced second-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations, earning him praise from analysts who said he is steering the bank in the right direction.</div><br/>

        <div>Strong results from investment banking helped Citi's April-to-June results, and the bank also benefited from setting aside less money for potential bad loans.</div><br/>

        <div>On calls with analysts and reporters, Corbat and his chief financial officer, John Gerspach, were peppered with questions about a number of potential challenges. Among them: Proposed regulations that could require big banks to hold more capital.</div><br/>

        <div>Longtime banking analyst Nancy Bush called Citi's call with analysts "the most straightforward and clear in my experience."</div><br/>

        <div>"There were times when I listened to their earnings call (in the past) and it was just unintelligible. I couldn't tell where they were going, what they were doing, and neither did they, apparently," Bush said. "Isn't it amazing what having a real banker as CEO can do?"</div><br/>

        <div>Profit for the April-to-June period was $3.9 billion, excluding an accounting gain, up from $3.1 billion a year ago.</div><br/>

        <div>That amounted to $1.25 per share, beating the $1.18 per share predicted by analysts polled by FactSet.</div><br/>

        <div>Revenue was $20 billion, excluding the accounting gain, up from $18.6 billion a year ago.</div><br/>

        New CEO Shuffles the Deck at Citi
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>Corbat Puts Stamp on Big Lender by Installing Co-Presidents, Reducing Influence of Pandit Allies</div><br/>

                      
        <div>Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Michael Corbat moved on Monday to cement his grip on the giant lender, outlining a management shuffle in which two top allies of former CEO Vikram Pandit will leave or have duties reduced.</div><br/>

        <div>Lewis B. Kaden, a Citigroup vice chairman since 2005 and a close adviser to Mr. Pandit, will retire from the New York company in coming weeks. Don Callahan, another of Mr. Pandit's longtime colleagues, will see his duties as head of technology and operations diminished.</div><br/>

        <div>Two other longtime Citigroup executives, James Forese and Manuel Medina-Mora, will see their roles expanded and become co-presidents. Mr. Foresee will oversee all of Citigroup's institutional clients businesses, adding transaction services to his current duties as head of securities and banking. Mr. Medina-Mora will continue to run global consumer banking as well as Citigroup's operations in Mexico. The post of chief operating officer that had been held by John Havens, who was forced to resign in October along with Mr. Pandit, will be eliminated.</div><br/>

        <div>Brian Leach, who worked with Messrs. Pandit and Havens before Citigroup and earned praise steering the company through the financial crisis as the chief risk officer, will assume a newly created role as head of franchise risk and strategy.</div><br/>

        <div>Separately, Richard Cookson, the chief investment officer of Citigroup's private bank, is leaving the company as part of a restructuring announced in December that will eliminate 11,000 jobs, said a person familiar with his plans. His position will be eliminated, according to an internal memo. Mr. Cookson declined to comment through a spokeswoman.</div><br/>

        <div>"While the responsibilities of some members of my team are changing, this leadership team and management structure will ensure continuity as we carry out our goals," Mr. Corbat said.</div><br/>

        <div>The elevation of Mr. Medina-Mora left analysts divided over the fate of Banamex, Citigroup's Mexican subsidiary. Investors have urged Citigroup to spin off or sell the division, options that some analysts said appeared to be off the table, given Mr. Medina-Mora's heightened powers. But Mike Mayo, an analyst with CLSA Credit Agrico, wrote in a note to clients that Mr. Medina-Mora's promotion "does not reduce the chance, in our view, that Citi either pursues a partial Mexico IPO or an entire sale."</div><br/>

        <div>The 70-year-old Mr. Kaden helped preside over several controversial decisions, including the $800 million purchase of Old Lane Partners LLC, a hedge fund that Mr. Pandit founded. It struggled with poor performance and closed soon after Citigroup acquired it. The deal brought Mr. Pandit to Citigroup in 2007.</div><br/>

        <div>Likewise, Mr. Kaden was instrumental in crafting a $400 million marketing deal in 2006 with the New York Mets that gave Citigroup naming rights to their stadium, called Citi Field. The agreement came under scrutiny a few years later, as Citigroup reeled from mounting losses and required taxpayer money to stay afloat.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Kaden declined to comment. He joined Citigroup from the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, where he was a partner. During the financial crisis he helped determine how to use $45 billion in federal bailout money Citi received.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Callahan, 56, was among Mr. Pandit's closest associates at the bank, having worked with him and Mr. Havens at Morgan Stanley.The executives made up a core that other managers said they found hard to penetrate.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Callahan will retain the title of chief operations and technology officer, but his other post as chief administrative officer will be eliminated and his duties will be reduced. In an email to employees, Mr. Callahan, who didn't return a call seeking comment, described the changes as a "natural evolution of the work we began five years ago, and enables our businesses to better execute coordinated strategies".</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup's shares are up 7.4% this year but have lost 90% of their value since late 2007. On Monday the shares rose 4 cents to $42.47.</div><br/>

        Newsmaker Touchdown for Corbat after 30 years on Wall Street
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <img class="a-img" src="img/corbat3.jpg"/>
        <div>(Reuters) - Michael Corbat, Citigroup Inc's new chief executive, is a survivor.</div><br/>

        <div>In a three-decade career that started at Salomon Brothers, the former offensive lineman for Harvard has endured countless mergers and succeeded in coming out on top.</div><br/>

        <div>He has run multiple units at Citigroup that allowed him to get to know the bank's board of directors, including wealth management and Citi Holdings, where the bank put bad assets it was looking to shed.</div><br/>

        <div>But Corbat, 52, whose athletic build and eyeglasses have earned comparisons with Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent, among colleagues, has a tough job ahead.</div><br/>

        <div>He must now reshape Citigroup in a new financial order, pulling back from products and geographical areas that are seen as "non-core" and negotiate with banking regulators. Citi needed three government rescues to make it through the financial crisis of 2008.</div><br/>

        <div>In a memo to employees after the announcement on Tuesday, Corbat said he believed the bank was on the right path.</div><br/>

        <div>"However, the environment is a challenging and dynamic one. Regulatory, legislative and economic changes around the world present headwinds as we redefine our relationships with all of our stakeholders."</div><br/>

        <div>Some experts who know Corbat said they were convinced that his no-nonsense approach is well suited to the bank's next chapter.</div><br/>

        <div>"I applaud the decision the board has made to name him CEO," said Sanford "Sandy" Weill, the tycoon who built Citigroup into a financial conglomerate. "He has been a great manager for Citi in all of the important positions he has held. He is respected by the people within the company and he will be a good leader for the team in the future."</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat's work for Citi Holdings sealed his reputation at the third-largest U.S. bank, executives said.</div><br/>

        <div>The task of extricating the bank from more than 40 businesses, including the initial public offering and sale of Citi's remaining stake in life insurer Primerica Inc, would have been seen as a poisoned chalice by many in the banking industry during such a turbulent period. But he sold more than $500 billion of assets while still getting high enough prices to build up much-needed capital.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat appeared to relish the task. He even described his job as "the easiest job in the world," because so many companies and funds were looking to buy Citigroup assets, according to one banking source, who declined to be named.</div><br/>

        <div>"He's really polished and measured," the source said, adding that Corbat showed an exceptional ability to forge successful alliances within the firm.</div><br/>

        <div>Corbat was rewarded for his success with his appointment at the start of this year as CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa, overseeing all of Citi's business operations in the region.</div><br/>

        <div>In that role, he steered the company through a raging euro crisis while also pursuing new business opportunities in the Gulf and Africa.</div><br/>

        <div>"He has great leadership capabilities. I think he will probably be in a better position to get regulatory approval for the return of excess capital," said Anthony Polini, analyst at Raymond James.</div><br/>

        <div>With the world economic picture still looking far from certain, Corbat will be able to make good use of the experience he gained from his involvement in sorting out the bankruptcy of Orange County, California and sovereign debt restructurings in Latin America as well as corporate clean-ups.</div><br/>

        <div>That is likely to require all the team building abilities he honed on the football field back at Harvard -- and likely give him less time to go fly fishing, a sport he is also known to enjoy.</div><br/>

        <div>"Everyone is important in their own way, but when you're in the game and a part of it, that day, you know you made a contribution," Corbat told the Harvard Crimson in the early 1980s.</div><br/>

        Not Going On TV and Telling Regulators to 'Regulate This [gestures at crotch]' Working Out Pretty Well for Mike Corbat
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <img class="a-img" src="img/corbat4.jpg"/>
        <div>Back in the day, as in pre-financial crisis, it was okay– nay, encouraged– for a bank chief executive officer to conduct himself in a brash, swaggering manner that communicated a general message of “I do what I want and if you don’t like it, suck on this.” Regulators were peons to be told where to go, the pages of the Journal were a place to thump their chests. San Pietro was a place for holding court while knocking back 9 martinis. If you didn’t like what they had to say, too damn bad.</div><br/>

        <div>Somewhere in the last couple years, though, things started to change. People no longer wanted to hear executives who helped cause the global financial crisis tell the world why they were right and you were wrong. Responding to calls that enormous bonuses struck an out of touch tone by inviting CNBC into their offices, dropping trau, telling the cameraman “you’re gonna wanna zoom in on this,” and rolling around in a pile of money with abandon was no longer as effective as it once was. Regulators no longer took kindly to receiving FedEx packages that included photographs of CEOs using pages of, for example Dodd-Frank, as toilet paper with a gold star atop that read “You tried.”</div><br/>

        <div>Some bank execs have been slow to catch on to this shift. Mike “can you spell that again” Corbat is notable in that he has not.</div><br/>

        <div>Michael L. Corbat, head of one of the biggest banks in the world, recently strolled through Marea, the Central Park South restaurant where Manhattan’s elite go to be seen. No one in the crowded room even looked up. A top New York lawyer dining there that evening was asked about Mr. Corbat. “Mike who?” he said. Flying under the radar appears to be just fine with Mr. Corbat — and with Citigroup, the financial giant he has run since October 2012. To be a prominent face of Wall Street at a time when banks are feeling the heat from federal authorities on a number of fronts clearly has its drawbacks. Mr. Corbat’s counterpart at rival JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, has been widely viewed as the point man for the bank as it wrestles with investigations by at least seven federal agencies, several state regulators and two foreign nations. And under Mr. Dimon, JPMorgan has in just a few years gone from a Washington favorite to a magnet for government scrutiny. The low-key approach taken by Citigroup — which faces a number of investigations of its own — has not gone unnoticed inside JPMorgan. Some board members and executives there have recently pointed to Mr. Corbat in privately discussing the apparent advantages of a more self-effacing approach in a chief executive…The change for Citigroup has been swift. Before Mr. Corbat took over, for example, the Fed dealt an embarrassing setback to the bank in 2012, when it failed the bank on the so-called stress test, an important measure of financial health, rejecting its proposal to buy back its shares. Just a year later, however, with Mr. Corbat at the helm, the bank handily passed the stress test. Its stock is up more than 40 percent since he took the top job.</div><br/>

        <div>Indeed, after he became chief following the ouster of Vikram S. Pandit, Mr. Corbat told advisers, including the public relations chief Edward Skyler, Susan Kendall, the head of investor relations, and John C. Gerspach, the chief financial officer, that he wanted to maintain a low profile, focusing on meetings with regulators, clients and analysts…That approach has even managed to win over one of Wall Street’s most vocal bank analysts, Michael Mayo, who had been a vociferous critic of Citigroup before Mr. Corbat’s appointment as chief. At the bank’s annual meeting in April, Mr. Mayo, whose approach to the microphone at such meetings usually involves a critical remark, lauded the bank. “The Mike and Mike show is off to a great start,” Mr. Mayo said, referring also to the bank’s chairman, Michael E. O’Neill.</div><br/>

        <div>If the Mayo love seems inconsequential, consider that not too long ago, the analyst was giving former chairman Dick Parsons two weeks to resign, talking public trash about the bank’s ATMs, and releasing the oh no he di’int statement that “Asking Vikram Pandit about the crisis in capitalism is like asking Alec Baldwin about airplane etiquette.”</div><br/>

        Quiet Boss at Citigroup Setting Tone for Wall Street
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <img class="a-img" src="img/corbat5.jpg"/>
        <div>Michael L. Corbat, head of one of the biggest banks in the world, recently strolled through Marea, the Central Park South restaurant where Manhattan’s elite go to be seen.</div><br/>

Some board members and executives there have recently pointed to Mr. Corbat in privately discussing the apparent advantages of a more self-effacing approach in a chief executive.</div><br/>

        <div>The perks of a lower profile have become clear to Mr. Dimon, too, according to people close to him who note he has recently refrained from giving interviews to focus, in part, on client meetings.</div><br/>

        <div>JPMorgan’s board, of course, remains solidly behind Mr. Dimon. But at least two directors, people close to the board say, have also privately acknowledged that Mr. Dimon’s previous offhandedness toward authorities — including his referring several years ago to the former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner as “Timmy” — at times rankled regulators, adding to the steep challenge the bank faces as it now tries to mend those frayed relationships.</div><br/>

        <div>Some bank lawyers say Mr. Corbat’s quiet, workmanlike persona may be better suited to the current regulatory environment.</div><br/>

        <div>He is also proof, say people close to JPMorgan, that a skilled but relatively unknown insider can run a large, complex financial institution, helping dispel a view that Mr. Dimon will be nearly impossible to replace as chief when he leaves the bank.</div><br/>

        <div>To be sure, it is not as easy for Mr. Dimon, given his long tenure on Wall Street, to fly under the radar. For his part, he has recently adopted a more contrite tone with Washington, and has apologized for letting down regulators, vowing to bolster controls at JPMorgan.</div><br/>

        <div>“We are building a more open and transparent relationship with our regulators,” Mr. Dimon said in a September memo to employees.</div><br/>

        <div>To help change the tenor of his relationship with regulators, Mr. Dimon held town-hall style meetings in May and June, convening authorities from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</div><br/>

        <div>And the bank’s recent $13 billion settlement does put some of its most troublesome legacy issues behind it. Yet JPMorgan continues to face investigations, including a roughly $6 billion trading loss in London last year and the hiring of well-connected employees in China.</div><br/>

        <div>At the same time, Citigroup’s favor within regulatory circles has grown — while its presence in the headlines has dwindled — since Mr. Corbat took the reins last year.</div><br/>

        <div>The change for Citigroup has been swift. Before Mr. Corbat took over, for example, the Fed dealt an embarrassing setback to the bank in 2012, when it failed the bank on the so-called stress test, an important measure of financial health, rejecting its proposal to buy back its shares.</div><br/>

        <div>Just a year later, however, with Mr. Corbat at the helm, the bank handily passed the stress test. Its stock is up more than 40 percent since he took the top job.</div><br/>

        <div>Wall Street has long been a breeding ground for executives with big, often brash, personalities.</div><br/>

        <div>Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, went from a relative unknown before the financial crisis, to one of its most vilified characters. To soften his reputation, Mr. Blankfein has actually stepped up his profile, giving more television interviews and taking on the role of Wall Street’s elder statesman.</div><br/>

        <div>Still, Mr. Dimon may be the best-known banker of them all. During the financial crisis, he was praised for successfully navigating JPMorgan through it.</div><br/>

        <div>In a 2009 biography of Mr. Dimon, “Last Man Standing,” Duff McDonald wrote: “Wall Street has always been a place for high-flying conquerors. But Jamie Dimon has proved that he is not one of them. As a result his legend will endure better than most, and it will be that of someone with the unique skills, experience and temperament to stand above his peers at a crucial moment in history.”</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Corbat, on the other hand, has inspired no such encomiums. Indeed, after he became chief following the ouster of Vikram S. Pandit, Mr. Corbat told advisers, including the public relations chief Edward Skyler, Susan Kendall, the head of investor relations, and John C. Gerspach, the chief financial officer, that he wanted to maintain a low profile, focusing on meetings with regulators, clients and analysts.</div><br/>

        <div>“I don’t want to meet my regulators on TV,” Mr. Corbat said to his top advisers not long after getting the job, according to one executive who spoke on the condition that he not be named because of a firm policy against speaking to the media.</div><br/>

        <div>Looking to avoid headlines, the group immediately decided that Mr. Corbat should not speak at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a magnet for those with, and seeking, power.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Corbat, through Mr. Skyler, declined to comment on the bank’s strategy. Mr. Skyler said the bank did not want to publicly discuss its communications strategy.</div><br/>

        <div>Still, over the past year, Mr. Corbat has conducted several hundred closed-door client and investor meetings and has met with President Obama twice.</div><br/>

        <div>That approach has even managed to win over one of Wall Street’s most vocal bank analysts, Michael Mayo, who had been a vociferous critic of Citigroup before Mr. Corbat’s appointment as chief. At the bank’s annual meeting in April, Mr. Mayo, whose approach to the microphone at such meetings usually involves a critical remark, lauded the bank.</div><br/>

        <div>“The Mike and Mike show is off to a great start,” Mr. Mayo said, referring also to the bank’s chairman, Michael E. O’Neill.</div><br/>

        <div>Even on the bank’s quarterly conference call with financial analysts, Mr. Corbat takes a back seat. He delivers opening remarks, but then turns most of the call over to Mr. Gerspach.</div><br/>

        <div>“Mike doesn’t want to be invisible, but he’s not interested in attention for attention’s sake,” said the person familiar with the bank’s strategy but not authorized to speak on the record.</div><br/>

        Rebounding Citi Stung by Slowdown
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>A year after taking over as chief executive of Citigroup Inc., C +0.38%  Michael Corbat is warning investors that the bank's sprawling collection of businesses could face more weakness in the months ahead.</div><br/>

        <div>The New York banking giant reported third-quarter results Tuesday that fell short of analyst estimates, hurt by a double-digit revenue drop in its fixed-income division, along with slides in mortgage-banking and investment-banking revenue.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Corbat, the Citigroup veteran who succeeded former CEO Vikram Pandit last October, has enjoyed a long honeymoon. Revenue gains in capital markets across the world have sent Citigroup's stock up about 41% in the past year, compared with the 27% rise for the KBW Bank Index. But Citigroup found the third quarter more difficult. When asked on a conference call about the firm's fixed-income performance, Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said "I can't think of a significant business that had revenue growth year over year."</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup was hit "across the board," added Richard Staite, an analyst with Atlantic Equities.</div><br/>

        <div>For the quarter, Citigroup reported net income of $3.23 billion, or $1 a share. That easily exceeded the profit of $468 million, or 15 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. But results fell short of last year's after excluding a $4.68 billion one-time expense tied to Citigroup's brokerage joint-venture Morgan Stanley MS +0.58%  Smith Barney in the third quarter of 2012.</div><br/>

        <div>Ever since Sanford I. Weill created Citigroup 15 years ago by merging Travelers Group and Citicorp, the bank has been designed as a one-stop financial supermarket in which weaknesses in some business areas could be offset by strengths in others. After billions of dollars in losses humbled Citigroup during the financial crisis, the bank scaled back, most recently turning to Mr. Corbat to slim it down and make it more profitable.</div><br/>

        <div>One of the most internationally focused of the U.S. megabanks, Citigroup long has worked on expanding in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere, while reducing its presence in the U.S. That strategy had been fueling the bank's growth.</div><br/>

        <div>But in the third quarter, Citigroup reported year-over-year revenue drops across all regions. Revenue fell 6.9% in North America, 13% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 1.3% in Latin America and 7.1% in Asia.</div><br/>

        <div>In all, Citigroup's per-share earnings fell to $1.02 from $1.06 a year earlier, after excluding one-time items and debt-valuation adjustments, or money the bank books based on the value of its own debt. On that basis, revenue dropped 4.9% to $18.22 billion, compared with an adjusted $19.16 billion a year ago.</div><br/>

        <div>Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected per-share earnings of $1.04 on revenue of $18.62 billion, excluding the valuation adjustments and items.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup shares fell 74 cents to $48.86 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</div><br/>

        <div>J.P. Morgan Chase JPM +0.94%  & Co. and Wells Fargo WFC +0.56%  & Co. also reported weakness in fixed-income trading and mortgage-banking revenue during the third quarter. But Citigroup posted even steeper declines. Mortgage-banking revenue plunged 76% from a year earlier and 72% from the previous quarter, to $167 million.</div><br/>

        <div>Mr. Corbat said during the company's conference call Tuesday that he wasn't satisfied with the results and warned that, "looking toward the end of the year, we believe it's going to remain a challenging environment."</div><br/>

        <div>"As has been the case historically, transitioning from a lower- to higher-rate environment doesn't happen without causing disruptions, especially in the emerging markets, and we're clearly seeing evidence of that," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>In the first half of the year, the biggest U.S. banks were able to offset weak results in their consumer businesses with strong trading revenue. But that ended in the third quarter, as slumping bond markets and low trading volumes led to the declines.</div><br/>

        <div>For the quarter, Citigroup reported fixed-income trading revenue fell 26% from a year earlier and 17% from the second quarter, to $2.78 billion, steeper drops than at J.P. Morgan, which reported its fixed-income trading revenue fell 7.7% from the year earlier and 16% from the second quarter.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup's equity-market revenue was mixed, climbing 36% from the year earlier but falling 25% from the second quarter. Investment-banking revenue was down 10% from the year earlier and 19% from the second quarter, to $839 million.</div><br/>

        <div>One bright spot: Citigroup continued to work to cut expenses, a focus of Mr. Corbat's since last year's ouster of Mr. Pandit.</div><br/>

        <div>Third-quarter operating expenses fell 3.6% year over year and 4% from the second quarter, to $11.66 billion. Legal costs were $677 million, up from $529 million a year earlier but down from $832 million in the second quarter.</div><br/>

        <div>The bank also narrowed its net loss at Citi Holdings, the division Citigroup put its distressed assets and unwanted parts into following the financial crisis, to $102 million from $670 million, after stripping out one-time items. Citi Holdings' assets shrank by 29%, to $122 billion, accounting for roughly 6% of the bank's total assets.</div><br/>

        Shelton High grad bringing Citigroup to new heights as CEO
    </div>
    <div class="a-body">
        <div>One day this April, Michael Corbat, the latest in a succession of CEOs at Citigroup, stood at a podium in a Manhattan hotel, looking out at a gathering of stockholders, for his first time leading the banking giant's annual meeting.</div><br/>

        <div>For Corbat, who grew up playing football in Shelton, this marked a high point in his 30-year journey up the ranks of Wall Street. Over the next 15 minutes, the 53-year-old led the crowd through the wonky details of the world's sixth-largest bank, a sprawling financial firm with some 250,000 employees, offices in over 100 countries and total assets of about $1.9 trillion.</div><br/>

        <div>He noted how the company had just completed its third year of profitability since the financial crisis, how its bolstered capital position recently impressed regulators. He acknowledged, too, some challenges, like the tens of billions of dollars of non-performing assets it's only slowly getting rid of -- a hangover, in part, from last decade's sub-prime mortgage frenzy.</div><br/>

        <div>"You know, in my first six months, I'm often asked how I will judge my tenure as CEO," he said.</div><br/>

        <div>He offered three answers: First, he wants Citi to achieve quality and consistent earnings. He also wants it to be known for making smart decisions. Finally, he wants to restore its reputation around the world.</div><br/>

        <div>With that, drawing on a focus that's well-remembered by his former Shelton High classmates, he described exactly how he plans to get there. "One word," he said. "Execution."</div><br/>

        <div>Middle-class upbringing</div><br/>

        <div>Michael L. Corbat came of age in what his old friends describe as a solidly middle-class corner of Shelton.</div><br/>

        <div>His father worked at GE. His mother ran a travel agency. He was a big, athletic kid, maybe 6-feet-tall in middle school, so it came as no surprise when he was named one of three captains of the 1978 Shelton High School football team.</div><br/>

        <div>He spent the next year at Choate Rosemary Hall, getting himself into academic shape to get into Harvard.</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup did not respond to a request from Hearst Connecticut Newspapers for an interview with Corbat.</div><br/>

        <div>But Brian Yachymczyk, his former football co-captain at Shelton High, who's spent the past 17 years living in Arizona, can fill in some details.</div><br/>

        <div>"It's been a while," he says, surprised by the mention of Corbat when a stranger calls. "He was a team player. Everyone liked him. He was a good student."</div><br/>

        <div>Good enough to go to Harvard? To climb the ranks of Wall Street?</div><br/>

        <div>"He was smart, but ..."</div><br/>

        <div>But Yachymczyk wants to see proof. Minutes later, the photo from the Citigroup website arrives in the old teammate's inbox: Immaculately parted hair. Muscular shoulders. Chiseled face.</div><br/>

        <div>The line goes silent.</div><br/>

        <div>"Holy s---," he says. "That's him, dude."</div><br/>

        <div>`Not as focused'</div><br/>

        <div>Last October, in a surprise move, Corbat was named CEO Vikram Pandit's replacement.</div><br/>

        <div>Pandit left Morgan Stanley at the height of the housing bubble and started a hedge fund that Citi bought in 2007. He'd promptly been appointed CEO of Citi, as the wheels of the company's subprime mortgage operation were falling off.</div><br/>

        <div>"There were a lot of very serious near-term challenges that Vikram needed to address, and he did," said David Hilder, a senior equity research analyst at Drexel Hamilton, describing the challenge of steering the company through a financial crisis while many called for Citi's dissolution after the federal government pumped it with a $45 billion bailout.</div><br/>

        <div>"After that, he laid out a much more long-term vision and strategy for Citi as a global wholesale bank and consumer bank in many emerging countries," Hilder said.</div><br/>

        <div>Pandit was "just not as focused as apparently the board wanted him to be on quarter-to-quarter operating earnings," Hilder said.</div><br/>

        <div>When the change in leadership was announced, reporters looking for background on the new CEO quickly found a glowing portrait of the man from a 1982 issue of The Harvard Crimson: "Mike Corbat: He's All-Ivy and a Perfect Team Player," it was called.</div><br/>

        <div>The man, apparently, had been a "6-foot-3, 230-pound dear," Harvard's only All-American, scouted by half a dozen NFL teams but giving every indication that he'd rather dress every morning in a suit and tie. He bemoaned the lack of respect he and his teammates were getting on campus for their brains. He'd started a cleaning, painting and landscaping business the previous February that employed up to 10 fellow students at a time and was turning a profit by that March.</div><br/>

        <div>"He's always been competitive in sports," his mother said in the Crimson article. "But he's always been able to make a dollar on his own."</div><br/>

        <div>Bond salesman</div><br/>

        <div>In 1983, he started making dollars for Salomon Brothers, selling bonds in Atlanta. He made managing director in 1993 and became head of Salomon's fixed-income sales. In 1998, when Salomon was subsumed by Travelers, which in turn was subsumed to Citi, Corbat started climbing the ranks.</div><br/>

        <div>By 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, he was named head of the global wealth management unit. Months later, he was named head of Citi Holdings, the "bad bank" of unwanted investments set up to shore up the overall company's balance sheet. He oversaw the sale of several hundred billion dollars in collateralized debt obligations, student loans and more.</div><br/>

        <div>Toxic assets, they were called.</div><br/>

        <div>"One of Wall Street's most thankless jobs," the New York Times called it.</div><br/>

        <div>Met at bus stop</div><br/>

        <div>He had experience with toxic assets, says Tony Caio.</div><br/>

        <div>In middle school, Caio moved from the Bronx, N.Y., to Shelton, four homes down from the Corbats. He describes the family as friendly and living simply and within their means.</div><br/>

        <div>"Mike was one of my first friends," Caio says. "We probably met at the bus stop."</div><br/>

        <div>In high school, Caio and "Corbs" sometimes worked together at the Pine Country Club pavilion, helping put on big concerts that included acts like Bob Marley and Bruce Springsteen. Afterward, one of the jobs was to load the garbage cans into a truck, haul it across the street, and dispose of it at the dump.</div><br/>

        <div>"The first few times, I would throw up because it smelled so bad," Caio recalls. "It was not a pleasant job."</div><br/>

        <div>He pauses.</div><br/>

        <div>"Mike did that job. I think he understood at a very early age the value of working."</div><br/>

        <div>Stock shines</div><br/>

        <div>Citigroup's stock has risen more than 50 percent since October, outperforming most of its large rivals. The company announced plans over the winter to cut some 11,000 jobs. Corbat outlined plans to streamline operations in the 100 or so countries where Citi operates, doubling down where conditions are good and reducing its footprint where it didn't make sense.</div><br/>

        <div>"That was something that hadn't been done there, almost ever," said Nancy Bush, a longtime bank analyst.</div><br/>

        <div>From April through June, Citi netted $3.9 billion in profits, up from $3.1 billion a year ago. The first half of this year has been the best for the company since before the financial crisis in 2007.</div><br/>

        <div>There is still a long way to go. Citi Holdings still has over $100 billion in bad assets. Some observers question if having such a massive global footprint even makes sense for a bank this day in age.</div><br/>

        <div>But for Bush, there is a ray of light at the top.</div><br/>

        <div>"For the first time in a long time, they actually have banking experience and talent at the top of the company and it's making a difference," Bush said. "To me, Corbat just seems like a quintessential operator."</div><br/>
